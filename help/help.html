            <h1>To enable microphone access for a website</h1>
            First ensure your device's microphone permissions are turned on in your device's settings. Then, when a website requests microphone access, allow it in the browser. In some browsers, you can also change the settings for a specific site to permanently allow or block microphone access. 
            Detailed Steps:
          <h3>  1. Device-Level Microphone Permissions:</h3>
            
           <h2> Windows:</h2>
            Go to Start > Settings > Privacy & security > Microphone. Make sure "Let apps access your microphone" is turned on. 
            
             <h2> macOS:</h2>
            Go to System Preferences > Privacy & Security > Microphone. Ensure the browser app you're using has microphone access enabled. 
            
        
            <h2> Chrome:</h2>
            Go to Chrome's settings (three dots) > Privacy and security > Site settings > Microphone. 
           
            <h2>Website-Specific Permissions:</h2>
            When visiting a website that requires microphone access, a dialog box may appear asking for permission. 
            Allow: Choose "Allow" to grant access. 
            Block: Choose "Block" to deny access. 
            Change Settings: In some browsers (like Chrome), you can adjust site-specific permissions for the microphone (e.g., allow always, ask every time, block). 
            
           <h2>3. Troubleshooting:</h2>
          <strong>  Microphone Not Working:</strong> Check if your device's microphone is enabled. 
            Browser Issues: Ensure your browser is up-to-date. 
            Network Issues: Some websites might not function correctly if you block their microphone access. 
            Contact Support: If the issue persists, consult the website's support or your browser's help documentation.
